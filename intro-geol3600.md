## Guest lecture in GEOL 3600

Hi, I'm Mark.
I work with Prof. Tucker.
He leads a group called the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System,
funded by the National Science Foundation.
CSDMS supports scientists who study physical processes occurring on or near the Earth's surface,
and they do so primarily through numerical models.

They write code.

This is a key point that the founders of CSDMS understood--that *software would have an increasing role in the practice of science*.

Nowadays, it's hard to be a scientist and not have some coding skills.
I think you all recognize that, and that's why you're here in Greg's class.

I'm an example of this increased emphasis on software in science.
I was an atmospheric scientist, but over time, I've shifted to become more of a software developer.
I support the scientists (including grad students and postdocs) writing code for numerical models.
My title within CSDMS is "research software engineer", a role that has just arisen in the last 10 years.

> As a quick aside: this is a valid career path!
If you find yourself interested in science, but even more interested in writing software, this is a job for you.
I really like what I do.

There is a problem, though: while software is increasingly relevant in science,
scientists are typically not very good at writing software.
We just don't receive the training to do so.

Therefore, a secondary goal of CSDMS is to help scientists in the community write better code.

And that's why I'm here today.

I'd like to talk to you about what we at CSDMS think are the keys to writing better code.
We can't go back and get computer science degrees,
so we try to boil down that body of knowledge into a few points, called best practices.
Best practices aren't rules, they're methods or techniques we can use to improve the quality of our work.

We have five best practices that we think are most important,
then another five that you can think of as stretch goals if you really want to improve the quality of your work.

Here they are...
