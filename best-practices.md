1
## Learn Python

\-

> [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)<br><small>[Software Carpentry]</small>

Note: It's the de facto standard in the geosciences, and in the physical sciences in general. 

---

2
## Use version control

\-

> [Why should I use version control?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1408450)<br><small>[Stack Overflow]</small>

Note: Never lose code again.

---

3
## Use the command line

\-

> [Five reasons why researchers should learn to love the command line](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00263-0)<br><small>[Nature]</small>

Note: Boost your efficiency on file operations.

4
## Learn a text editor

\-

> [Text Editors and Development Environments](https://github.com/csdms/ivy/tree/main/lessons/editors)<br><small>[CSDMS Ivy]</small>

Note: Pick one, it doesn't matter which.

---

5
## Share code

\-

> [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)<br><small>[Eric S. Raymond; Wikipedia]</small>

Note: This is an ongoing culture shift within the geosciences.

## Summary

1. Learn Python
1. Use version control
1. Use the command line
1. Learn a text editor
1. Share code

Note: Extended recommendations follow, if students are interested.

---

6
## Test code

Note: Catch problems before they happen.

---

7
## Write documentation

Note: Documentation is as important as code.

---

8
## Use libraries

Note: Don't reinvent the wheel.

---

9
## Script everything

Note: Don't repeat code.

---

10
## Premature optimization<br>is the root of all evil

> -- Donald Knuth

Note: First, make it work. Then, if needed, make it better.

---

## Summary

6. Test code
1. Write documentation
1. Use libraries
1. Script everything
1. Make it work first
